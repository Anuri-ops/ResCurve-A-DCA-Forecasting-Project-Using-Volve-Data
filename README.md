# 📘 ResCurve: A DCA & Forecasting Project Using Volve Data

This project uses production data from the **Volve field** (Norwegian Continental Shelf) to estimate reserves, apply decline curve models, and forecast future production trends.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

Using historical production data for multiple wellbores, the goal is to:

- Apply **Decline Curve Analysis (DCA)** models: Exponential, Harmonic, and Hyperbolic
- Estimate **Original Oil in Place (OOIP)** using simplified material balance
- Forecast **future production** using the best-fit decline model
- Generate **clean, visual plots** to support reservoir performance interpretation

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

This analysis is implemented in **Python**, using the following packages:

- `openpyxl` – Reading Excel files
- `pandas` – Data cleaning and manipulation
- `matplotlib` – Plotting production trends and model fits
- `numpy` – Numerical computations and model calculations
- `scipy.optimize` – Curve fitting (nonlinear regression)
- `sklearn.metrics` – Model performance evaluation (RMSE, R²)

---

## 📚 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes daily and monthly production volumes for 7 wellbores, including:

- Oil, gas, and water production (Sm³)
- Well names, dates, and operational metadata
- Injection volumes (where available)

## 🔍 Key Findings

### ✅ Well Selection – 15/9-F-12

**Well 15/9-F-12** was selected for decline analysis due to:

- 📈 Long Production Life: Over 3000 days of production data  
- 🛢️ High Cumulative Output: ~4.5 million Sm³  
- ⏱️ Consistent Production Trends: Minimal interruptions  
- 📉 Clear Decline Pattern: Ideal for decline curve model fitting  

---

### 📉 Decline Curve Fitting

- The **hyperbolic model** provided the best match to historical data:
  - **RMSE = 944.97**, **R² = 0.6769**
  - Selected as the **best-fit model** for forecasting and EUR estimation.

### 🔮 Forecasting & EUR

- Forecasted oil rate over ~5000 days using the hyperbolic model
- **Economic limit**: 100 Sm³/day  
- **Limit reached**: Day 4048  
- **Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR)**: 5,026,990 Sm³

### 🧮 OOIP Estimation

- Used a simplified material balance approach  
- Assumed Bo = 1.2 reservoir bbl/STB (due to missing PVT)  
- **Estimated OOIP**: 609,865,650 Sm³
